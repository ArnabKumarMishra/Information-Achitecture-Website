  <p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation website. We are one of the largest independent petroleum product refiners and marketers in the United States and one of the largest operators of company-owned and operated retail gasoline outlets in the United States, and we own one of the largest terminal and pipeline systems in the United States. We own and operate seven refineries, located in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.7 million barrels per day. We sell our refined products to wholesale customers, including private-brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers, and we also distribute our refined products through a large network of retail stores and stations. We have an extensive distribution network, which we use to deliver crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We believe that the size and reach of our refining, marketing and transportation network, our brand strength, and the convenience and reliability we bring to our consumers have been the keys to the success and strong financial performance of our business.</p>

  <p>
  Our strategy as an independent company is to maximize the profitability of our operations by (1) continuing to develop opportunities for expansion and asset upgrading and (2) pursuing opportunities to expand our operating margins through development of greater flexibility in our refining feedstocks and through production of more high-value-added end products. We believe that our strengths, including our coordinated network of refineries, our extensive network of pipelines, terminals and other distribution facilities, our competitively positioned retail-marketing locations and our operating expertise enables us to deliver competitive returns to our stockholders. We are very excited about our prospects and believe we are better positioned to realize the growth opportunities for our business as an independent company.
  </p>

  <p>
  I invite you to learn more about Marathon Petroleum Corporation by reviewing the information on this website. We are proud to be an independent, publicly traded company and look forward to rewarding your loyalty as a holder of Marathon Petroleum Corporation common stock.
