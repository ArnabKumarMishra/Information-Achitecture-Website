        <p>
        There is nothing like planning your first safari -there are so many opportunities for exploration and relaxation, so many ideas to consider. With a map of Africa laid out before you, the possibilities play like a movie in your mind: Rolling along a golden landscape, your eyes plying the plains for a spectacular sight. Drifting through winding waterway in a rough-hewn mokoro, straining to hear the rustle of animals through the peaceful silence in the bush, or strolling through the verdant vineyards of the Cape Winelands. When the choices are both exquisite and seemingly endless…where does one begin? We’re here to help.

        <h2 id = "ikopusa">Passports and Visas</h2>
        <p>
        When preparing for your safari, it's important to start with the basics. And all the safari planning starts with making sure you have a valid passport and have any necessary visas for your trip.</p>

        <p>All travellers must have current passports valid for 6 months after the expected departure date from Africa. Visas are required for Kenya and Tanzania. A visa kit will be sent to all guests along with their other documents. A visa is also required for Zambia—it is obtained at point of entry and no photos are required. The visa fee must be paid in US dollars, and the amount is dependent upon when you are travelling.</p>

        <p>No visas are required for South Africa or Botswana for American or Canadian citizens.
        Please note that anyone travelling to Kenya or South Africa must have two consecutive blank visa pages in their passport, which lie side by side when the passport is open (i.e. a left and a right hand page). Please note the last few pages of US passports are amendment/ endorsements pages; these pages do not count as visa pages. Just as a precaution, your passport should have at least 2 blank visa pages for each country you visit including any extensions. In addition, a parent travelling with children, without the other parent, will need a letter of consent from the absent parent. The letter of consent must be certified by the police.</p>

        <p>Visit The US State Department to find information on obtaining a US passport. For information on obtaining a Kenyan visa, log on to the Kenya Ministry of Tourism. For information on obtaining a visa for Tanzania, visit the Tanzania Tourist Board's website.</p>

        <h2 id = "ikopusa">What to Wear on Safari</h2>
        <p>
        Safari clothing should be comfortable and casual—suffice it to say, any fine jewellery should be left at home. And while it's not actually necessary to dress like an old safari hand, you won't feel out of place if you do since that's the everyday attire of the locals—i.e., the present-day "old safari hands" whose great-grandparents moved to Africa from England and points beyond. Plus, there are valid reasons to do so.</p>

        <p>Wearing white increases your visibility to wildlife, while bright colors, particularly red, can frighten animals. (It is said that lions fear red because it is the color worn by the Maasai, who hunt lion as a part of their coming of age rituals.) Khaki, olive, tans and browns increase your chances of good game viewing (particularly on a walking safari), while offering the added advantage of concealing dirt and dust. Not to mention that all of those pockets on safari shirts, vests and jackets are infinitely useful in the bush!</p>

        <h2 id = "ikopusa">Weather Conditions</h2>
        
        <p>Both East and Southern Africa enjoy glorious climates and both can accurately be called year-round destinations.</p>

        <p>East Africa enjoys glorious climates and can accurately be called a year-round destination. In Kenya and Tanzania, a blissful 70 degrees Fahrenheit greets the day and rarely does the temperature vary throughout the year. It is one of those exceptional areas of the world that enjoys "eternal spring." Yet, located on the equator, a widespread misconception is that the weather is hot and sultry. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth! The elevated altitudes keep temperatures utterly balmy and comfortable, even calling for sweaters and jackets every evening and morning.</p>

        <p>No matter when you go to Southern Africa, the region offers thoroughly agreeable weather for all safari activities. Southern Africa experiences more noticeable changes in its seasons. April through November is Southern Africa's winter, when daytime temperatures are a fresh 60-75 degrees with little rain. During the height of Southern Africa's summer (December through March), temperatures are warmer and some rain may fall, making the bush lush and green.</p>
